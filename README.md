# TREC
This program was written as part of the course Object-oriented Analysis and Design on the TU Graz in the Wintersemester 2018/19.

It is a hotel recommendation software, built with the Java GUI Swing. 

Customers can set interests and activities and based on those, they get hotels recommended. Vice versa, the owners of hotels can see which customers could 
be interested in their hotel, based on the preferences of the customers.  

After an overnight stay, a customer can make an evaluation of the hotel and set ratings for the offered activities. This rating has an impact on the
recommendation algorithm in further consequence.
